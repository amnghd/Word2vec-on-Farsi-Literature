# Word2vec model for Farsi literature

This document is dedicated to providing a word2vec model developed for Farsi poems of 48 poets. The complete list of poets and their documents are avaialble [here](https://github.com/amnghd/Persian_poems_corpus).

## Brief introduction to Farsi poems:

Traditional Farsi poems are a set of sentence rows know as ``beyts``. Each beyt is split into two ``mesra`` that could be thought of as clauses that complete each other to form a meaningful sentence.
Most of the exisiting Farsi literature are composed in this frame work of mesra and beyts. Here is an example of a Farsi poem by [Rumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi):

**(beyt1-mesra1)**

Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,

**(beyt1-mesra2)**

there is a field.  I'll meet you there.

**(beyt2-mesra1)**
When the soul lies down in that grass,

**(beyt2-mesra2)**

the world is too full to talk about.

**(beyt3-mesra1)**

Ideas, language, even the phrase each other

**(beyt3-mesra2)**
doesn't make any sense.
